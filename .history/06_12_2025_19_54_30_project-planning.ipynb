    "To build up success of online research platforms, particularly platforms collecting data on player activity in a video game environment, hinges on effective communication with and retain the user base. For the UBC Computer Science research group led by Frank Wood, which operates the MineCraft server, identifying the player characteristics that predict engagement and newsletter subscription is vital for optimizing recruitment and outreach strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The core question is: **What player characteristics are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?** More specifically: **How might a player's experience and total hours played predict their tendency to subscribe to a newsletter? And how does this differ between players of various ages?** \n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the dataset `players.csv`, which contains unique player records with their descriptive features such as age and gender (see **Table 1** for a detailed description of each variable). We will begin by outlining the necessary data wrangling and cleaning procedures to address missing values (NA) and properly structure the dataset for modeling. Next, exploratory data analysis will be performed to visualize trends between player attributes (`Age`, `experience`, `played_hours`) and the binary subscription outcomes (`subscribe`). \n",
    "We will then implement and evaluate a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification model to predict players' subscription status, providing insights into which player profiles may be most responsive to targeted communication strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "A potential limitation is the presence of missing data in the dataset. Additionally, `players.csv` is a relatively small dataset with only 196 observations, which may constrain the model's predictive accuracy. "

The vast majority of players have logged fewer than 10 hours on the server, with only a small subset exceeding 50 hours, and a few extreme cases reaching over 150-200 hours. This indicates that the population mainly consists of casual players, while highly engaged players are comparatively rare.

    "This result aligns with the expectation given the highly imbalanced dataset. To be more specific, KNN tends to favor the majority class when class distributions are uneven, especially when only two predictors (`experience` and `played_hours`) are used. While it was expected that the model would predict subscribers reasonably well, the complete failure to predict non-subscribers highlights the limitation of KNN in handling cases when classes are imbalanced.\n",

    "**What impact could such findings have:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model’s bias toward the majority class limits its practical usefulness. In our case, the research team needs to target recruitment effectively and ensure they have enough resources to handle the player load. However, because our model predicts everyone as a subscriber, the team would likely overestimate demand, allocating more resources than necessary. This could be inefficient and costly, particularly for a university-run-project with limited funding and server capacity. \n",
    "Besides, since our model fails to identify non-subscribers, any recruitment strategies aimed at engaging them would be misguided, as the team would have no way knowing which players are less likely to participate. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What future questions could this lead to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can the model be improved to handle imbalanced data more effectively?\n",
    "- Would incorporating additional features such as age and gender improve classification of non-subscribers?"
